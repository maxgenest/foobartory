# Foobartory

A project by Maxime Genestier

## Run project

```
npm install
npm start
```

Click on "Nouveau jeu" to reset the game to 2 robots and 0 resource.

The game end when you have 20 robots.

## To fix

- it is not possible to build 2 resources simultaneously => I should split reducer and context by resource.

## Next step

- make it mobile friendly.
- add a progress to show resource building time.
